## Python PIP - Python Package Manager

### What is PIP ?

PIP stands for Preferred installer program. We use _pip_ to install different Python packages.
Package is a Python module that can contain one or more modules or other packages. A module or modules that we can install to our application is a package.
In programming, we do not have to write every utility program, instead we install packages and import them to our applications.

### Installing PIP

If you did not install pip, let us install it now. Go to your terminal or command prompt and copy and paste this:

```sh
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ pip install pip
```

Check if pip is installed by writing

```sh
pip --version
```

```py
asabeneh@Asabeneh:~$ pip --version
pip 21.1.3 from /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.9.6)
```

As you can see, I am using pip version 21.1.3, if you see some number a bit below or above that, means you have pip installed.

Let us check some of the packages used in the Python community for different purposes. Just to let you know that there are lots of packages available for use with different applications.

### Installing packages using pip

Let us try to install _numpy_, called numeric python. It is one of the most popular packages in machine learning and data science community.

- NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:
  - a powerful N-dimensional array object
  - sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
  - tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
  - useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities
