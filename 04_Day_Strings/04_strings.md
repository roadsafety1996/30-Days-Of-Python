## Strings

Text is a string data type. Any data type written as text is a string. Any data under single, double or triple quote are strings. There are different string methods and built-in functions to deal with string data types. To check the length of a string use the len() method.

### Creating a String

```py
letter = 'P'                # A string could be a single character or a bunch of texts
print(letter)               # P
print(len(letter))          # 1
greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # String could be made using a single or double quote,"Hello, World!"
print(greeting)             # Hello, World!
print(len(greeting))        # 13
sentence = "I hope you are enjoying 30 days of Python Challenge"
print(sentence)
```
Multiline string is created by using triple single (''') or triple double quotes ("""). See the example below.

multiline_string = '''I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python.'''
print(multiline_string)

### String Concatenation

We can connect strings together. Merging or connecting strings is called concatenation. See the example below:

```py
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
space = ' '
full_name = first_name  +  space + last_name
print(full_name) # Asabeneh Yetayeh
# Checking the length of a string using len() built-in function
print(len(first_name))  # 8
print(len(last_name))   # 7
print(len(first_name) > len(last_name)) # True
print(len(full_name)) # 16

### String formatting

#### Old Style String Formatting (% Operator)

In Python there are many ways of formatting strings. In this section, we will cover some of them.
The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.<small>number of digits</small>f".

- %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
- %d - Integers
- %f - Floating point numbers
- "%.<small>number of digits</small>f" - Floating point numbers with fixed precision

# Strings only
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am %s %s. I teach %s' %(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of circle with a radius %d is %.2f.' %(radius, area) # 2 refers the 2 significant digits after the point

python_libraries = ['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']
formated_string = 'The following are python libraries:%s' % (python_libraries)
print(formated_string) # "The following are python libraries:['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']"
```
### Python Strings as Sequences of Characters

Python strings are sequences of characters, and share their basic methods of access with other Python ordered sequences of objects – lists and tuples. The simplest way of extracting single characters from strings (and individual members from any sequence) is to unpack them into corresponding variables.

#### Unpacking Characters
language = 'Python'
a,b,c,d,e,f = language # unpacking sequence characters into variables
print(a) # P
print(b) # y
print(c) # t
print(d) # h
print(e) # o
print(f) # n
```
#### Accessing Characters in Strings by Index
In programming counting starts from zero. Therefore the first letter of a string is at zero index and the last letter of a string is the length of a string minus one.

![String index](../images/string_index.png)
language = 'Python'
first_letter = language[0]
print(first_letter) # P
second_letter = language[1]
print(second_letter) # y
last_index = len(language) - 1
last_letter = language[last_index]
print(last_letter) # n
```

If we want to start from right end we can use negative indexing. -1 is the last index.

```py
language = 'Python'
last_letter = language[-1]
print(last_letter) # n
second_last = language[-2]
print(second_last) # o
```

#### Slicing in Python 

In python we can slice strings into substrings.

```py
language = 'Python'
first_three = language[0:3] # starts at zero index and up to 3 but not include 3
print(first_three) #Pyt
last_three = language[3:6]
print(last_three) # hon
# Another way
last_three = language[-3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
last_three = language[3:]
print(last_three)   # hon

#### Reversing a String

We can easily reverse strings in python.

greeting = 'Hello, World!'
print(greeting[::-1]) # !dlroW ,olleH
